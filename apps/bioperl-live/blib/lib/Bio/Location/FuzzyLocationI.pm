=head1 NAME

Bio::Location::FuzzyLocationI - Abstract interface of a Location on a Sequence
which has unclear start/end location

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Get a FuzzyLocationI object somehow
    print "Fuzzy FT location string is ", $location->to_FTstring();
    print "location is of the type ", $location->loc_type, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface encapsulates the necessary methods for representing a
Fuzzy Location, one that does not have clear start and/or end points.
This will initially serve to handle features from Genbank/EMBL feature
tables that are written as 1^100 meaning between bases 1 and 100 or
E<lt>100..300 meaning it starts somewhere before 100.  Advanced
implementations of this interface may be able to handle the necessary
logic of overlaps/intersection/contains/union.  It was constructed to
handle fuzzy locations that can be represented in Genbank/EMBL.

=head1 LocationI methods

=head2 min_start

  Title   : min_start
  Usage   : my $minstart = $location->min_start();
  Function: Get minimum starting location of feature startpoint   
  Returns : integer or undef if no maximum starting point.
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 max_start

  Title   : max_start
  Usage   : my $maxstart = $location->max_start();
  Function: Get maximum starting location of feature startpoint  
  Returns : integer or undef if no maximum starting point.
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 start_pos_type

  Title   : start_pos_type
  Usage   : my $start_pos_type = $location->start_pos_type();
  Function: Get start position type (ie <,>, ^) 
  Returns : type of position coded as text 
            ('BEFORE', 'AFTER', 'EXACT','WITHIN', 'BETWEEN')
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 min_end

  Title   : min_end
  Usage   : my $minend = $location->min_end();
  Function: Get minimum ending location of feature endpoint 
  Returns : integer or undef if no minimum ending point.
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 max_end

  Title   : max_end
  Usage   : my $maxend = $location->max_end();
  Function: Get maximum ending location of feature endpoint 
  Returns : integer or undef if no maximum ending point.
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 end_pos_type

  Title   : end_pos_type
  Usage   : my $end_pos_type = $location->end_pos_type();
  Function: Get end position type (ie <,>, ^) 
  Returns : type of position coded as text 
            ('BEFORE', 'AFTER', 'EXACT','WITHIN', 'BETWEEN')
  Args    : none

=cut

=head2 seq_id

  Title   : seq_id
  Usage   : my $seqid = $location->seq_id();
  Function: Get/Set seq_id that location refers to
  Returns : seq_id
  Args    : [optional] seq_id value to set

=cut

=head2 coordinate_policy

  Title   : coordinate_policy
  Usage   : $policy = $location->coordinate_policy();
            $location->coordinate_policy($mypolicy); # set may not be possible
  Function: Get the coordinate computing policy employed by this object.

            See Bio::Location::CoordinatePolicyI for documentation about
            the policy object and its use.

            The interface *does not* require implementing classes to accept
            setting of a different policy. The implementation provided here
            does, however, allow to do so.

            Implementors of this interface are expected to initialize every
            new instance with a CoordinatePolicyI object. The implementation
            provided here will return a default policy object if none has
            been set yet. To change this default policy object call this
            method as a class method with an appropriate argument. Note that
            in this case only subsequently created Location objects will be
            affected.

  Returns : A Bio::Location::CoordinatePolicyI implementing object.
  Args    : On set, a Bio::Location::CoordinatePolicyI implementing object.

=head2 to_FTstring

  Title   : to_FTstring
  Usage   : my $locstr = $location->to_FTstring()
  Function: returns the FeatureTable string of this location
  Returns : string
  Args    : none
